## Email Configuration

The app uses two email addresses:

1. **Sender Email (Gmail Account)**
   - This is the Gmail account that will be used to send the notifications
   - You need to modify `N26NotificationListener.java` and replace:
     - `"your-email@gmail.com"` with your Gmail address
     - `"your-app-password"` with an App Password from your Google Account
   - To get an App Password:
     1. Go to your Google Account settings
     2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
     3. Go to Security â†’ App Passwords
     4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
     5. Use this password in the code

2. **Recipient Email (Configuration)**
   - This is where you want to receive the N26 notifications
   - Configure this in the app's UI
   - Can be any email address (doesn't have to be Gmail)

### Required Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:
- Notification access (to read N26 notifications)
